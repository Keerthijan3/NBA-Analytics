# NBA-Analytics

This a repo of some NBA analysis scripts. Each script has more information on how to run it

Proj 1: Outputs plots based on NBA player heights and weights over the years. The standard deviation is also outputted. 
This script also accepts a position to filter the players by position.

Proj 2: This script similar to Proj 1 analyzes metrics of players over the years by position. (ex. how much more three pointers
are taken by centers?)

Proj 3: This script does a PCA analysis of NBA players per season. Two axis for defense and offense are made which consists of
various player skill metrics.
